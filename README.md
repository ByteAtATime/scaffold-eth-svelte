# Scaffold-ETH-Svelte

A port of [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) into SvelteKit/SvelteJS 5.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/byteatatime/scaffold-eth-svelte.git
cd scaffold-eth-svelte
yarn
```

2. Run a local chain

```
yarn chain
```

3. On a second terminal, deploy the example contract

```
yarn deploy
```

4. Start the frontend

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Documentation

This part is currently WIP. For now, you can refer to the [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/) documentation, as most of the concepts are the same.
